1. Create a New Branch:
   - First, switch to the `master` branch:
     
     git checkout master
     
   - Then create a new branch (let's call it `new-feature`):
     
     git branch new-feature
     

2. Make Commits in the New Branch:
   - Switch to the new branch:
     
     git checkout new-feature
     
   - Develop your code, make changes, and commit them:
     
     git add .
     git commit -m "Your commit message"
     

3. Merge the New Branch into Master:
   - Switch back to the `master` branch:
     
     git checkout master
     
   - Merge the changes from `new-feature` into `master`:
     
     git merge new-feature
     

4. Push Changes to Remote Repository (Optional):
   - If you're ready to share your changes, push them to the remote repository:
     
     git push origin master
